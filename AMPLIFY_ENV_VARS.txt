LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME = centralized-delivery-platform-FastApiFunction
API_GATEWAY_URL = https://l17hfioxt7.execute-api.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/api/

🔧 For AWS Amplify Static Hosting:

1. Use amplify_production.yml as the build configuration
2. Set baseDirectory to: fastapi-template/static
3. No environment variables needed (frontend only)
4. The build process will automatically update API URLs

📋 Files to Deploy:
   ├── login.html (with updated API endpoint)
   ├── index.html (dashboard)
   ├── All supporting HTML/CSS/JS files
   └── Updated meta tags pointing to live Lambda API

✅ BACKEND STATUS:
   ├── AWS Lambda: ✅ Deployed and Running
   ├── API Gateway: ✅ Configured and Accessible  
   ├── RDS Database: ✅ Connected
   ├── Authentication: ✅ Working (JWT tokens)
   └── Static Files: ✅ Served by Lambda

🌐 Live Endpoints:
   ├── Main App: https://l17hfioxt7.execute-api.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/api/
   ├── Login: https://l17hfioxt7.execute-api.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/api/login
   ├── Dashboard: https://l17hfioxt7.execute-api.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/api/dashboard
   └── Health: https://l17hfioxt7.execute-api.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/api/health

💡 NOTE: 
The backend is fully operational on AWS Lambda. Amplify is only needed 
for serving the static frontend files if you want CDN distribution or 
alternative hosting for the frontend assets.
