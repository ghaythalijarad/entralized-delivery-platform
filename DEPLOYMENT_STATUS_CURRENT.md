# ðŸš€ AWS App Runner Deployment Status & Next Steps

## Current Status: DEPLOYING ðŸ”„

The AWS App Runner service has been updated with the following fixes:
- âœ… Added missing `requirements.txt` in fastapi-template directory
- âœ… Simplified configuration to use SQLite (no RDS dependency)
- âœ… Fixed database configuration to handle environment variables properly
- âœ… Code pushed to GitHub and deployment triggered

## Service Details
- **Service Name:** entralized-delivery-api
- **Region:** eu-west-1 (Ireland)
- **Primary URL:** https://ff201cf70ebb4a2085b0d8655f59798e.eu-west-1.awsapprunner.com
- **Alternative URL:** https://3mvwdnkjmg.eu-west-1.awsapprunner.com
- **GitHub Repo:** https://github.com/ghaythalijarad/entralized-delivery-platform

## What Was Fixed
1. **Missing Dependencies:** Added `requirements.txt` in the correct location
2. **Database Issues:** Switched from RDS to SQLite for simplicity
3. **Configuration:** Simplified apprunner.yaml to avoid region mismatches
4. **Environment:** Proper handling of DATABASE_URL environment variable

## Testing When Ready
Once the service is running, test with:
```bash
# Test health
curl https://ff201cf70ebb4a2085b0d8655f59798e.eu-west-1.awsapprunner.com/health

# Test login
curl -X POST https://ff201cf70ebb4a2085b0d8655f59798e.eu-west-1.awsapprunner.com/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "admin123"}'
```

## Next Steps (When Deployment Completes)
1. **Update Frontend API Configuration:**
   ```bash
   ./update_frontend_api.sh https://ff201cf70ebb4a2085b0d8655f59798e.eu-west-1.awsapprunner.com
   ```

2. **Deploy Frontend to AWS Amplify:**
   - Login to AWS Console
   - Go to AWS Amplify
   - Create new app from GitHub repository
   - Use amplify.yml configuration
   - Deploy static frontend

3. **Test Production Login:**
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`

## Monitoring Deployment
Check deployment status in AWS Console:
- **App Runner:** https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/
- **CloudWatch Logs:** View deployment logs in the App Runner console

## Estimated Deployment Time
AWS App Runner deployments typically take 5-15 minutes depending on:
- Code complexity
- Dependency installation
- Database initialization

## Current Local Status
âœ… Local backend is running and fully functional
âœ… All login functionality works locally
âœ… Frontend is ready for production deployment
âœ… All deployment files are prepared

## If Deployment Fails Again
If the deployment fails, check the CloudWatch logs in the AWS Console for specific error messages. Common issues:
- Python version compatibility
- Missing dependencies
- Environment variable configuration
- Database connection issues

The current configuration should work as it uses SQLite and has all dependencies properly specified.
